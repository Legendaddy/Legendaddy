Hello,

Generalist Ingeneer, i work since 10 years in raillaway train conception and operation.
For 5 year, i work to develop systems to inprove maintenance.

To do that, i use the language python [:star::star::star:]. 

I have work in the past with java[:star:] and C# [:star:].

I exploit sqlServer [:star::star:] and postgre [:star::star:] to manipulate project data.

Since 2020, i learn many other language, framework and concept to upgrade my skill.
- HTML [:star::star:], 
- CSS [:star::star:], 
- JS [:star::star:],
- REACT [:star::star:], 
- Redux [:star::star:],
- Django [:star::star:],
- pandas [:star::star:], 
- numpy [:star:]
- scikitlearn [:star:]

I think, the fact i has a generalist ingeneer, it's a good and a bad think. :smirk:

Not a specialist in developement, i structure my work like my profesional project. :blush:
